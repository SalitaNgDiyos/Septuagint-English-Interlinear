#Bible Texts that are being proofread namely, 
1. Brenton's English Version of the Traditional LXX
2. Traditional LXX (Greek) Text

#Project Goals
1. Fix typo errors. Errors are determined by comparing TW module text w/ the source: http://www.archive.org/details/septuagintversio1900bren
2. Make sure both texts are aligned w/ the KJV verse order as much as possible; otherwise, a verse number/[rule] should them indicate in the final module
