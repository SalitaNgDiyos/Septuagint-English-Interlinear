#Bible Texts that are being proofread namely, 
1. Brenton's English Version of the Traditional LXX
2. Traditional LXX (Greek) Text

#Work Goals
1. Fix typo errors.
2. Make sure both texts are aligned w/ the KJV verse order as much as possible; otherwise, a verse number/[rule] should indicate otherwise in the final module
